Issue3401.agda:12,5-6
Variable generalization failed.
  - Probable cause
      There were unsolved constraints that obscured the dependencies
      between the generalized variables.
  - Suggestion
      The most reliable solution is to provide enough information to make
      the dependencies clear, but simply mentioning the variables in the
      right order should also work.
  - Further information
    - Dependency analysis suggested this (likely incorrect) order: v
    - The dependency I error is
